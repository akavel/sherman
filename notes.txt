This code is getting pretty old and it seems that it has some problems
with modern versions of FLEX and Scheme.  Here are some things I
discovered while debugging this in 2007.

1.  Under Linux, you can generate the scanner like this:

    flex --warn -i R2S.L
    gcc lex.yy.c -lfl

2.  For some reason, the DATE and TIME patterns are matching.
    I don't understand this, but if you delete the patterns you can
    get something working.

3.  I've preprocessed the sample files.  The .s version is the
    expected output.
